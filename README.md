A tool for peer review in an organization.
Can give editable ratings, reviews to other people anonymously.

First clone the repository using ```git clone``` . Then run by any of the methods.

1. Using Anaconda :

## To-Do

- [x] Group data into lesser forms. Currently work form can only add the data and not delete it.

- [ ] Adding histograms to see the cumulative ratings of users across sessions

- [x] Toggle between Log-out and Register buttons once the user has logged in. If the user hasn't logged in, don't display the Log-Out button.

- [x] Changing the current rating system to that of a system defined value of integers that the user can choose from.

- [x] Encrypting senstive data so that even the superuser can't view it.

- [ ] Having a trustworthy review system if a user is unhappy with a particular rating.

- [x] Send a prompt if login fails.

- [x] Adding a considerable amount of "works" makes the individual fields non-readable. Need to have dynamic blocks which change dimensions according to the text.
